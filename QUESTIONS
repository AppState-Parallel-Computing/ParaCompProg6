1. Run the program using the options specified below and fill in the speedup values
Be sure the code has been compiled with the NODEBUGFLAGS to get the best performance.
Omit the -s option to avoiding running the slower sequential version
(The sequential time is estimated if it isn't actually executed.)

arraySize     numThreads     Speedup 1.      Speedup 2.     Speedup 3.
(1 << 15)        16         
(1 << 15)        32      
(1 << 18)        16      
(1 << 18)        32   

2. Your results should indicate that increasing the number of threads also
causes an increase in the speedup.  Explain why.


3. Your results should indicate that there is a higher speedup for the
larger array size for the same number of threads.  Explain why.
