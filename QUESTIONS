1. Run the program using the options specified below and fill in the speedup values
Be sure the code has been compiled with the NODEBUGFLAGS to get the best performance.
Omit the -s option to avoiding running the slower sequential version

Note: even the parallel version will be slow for the (1 << 20) array size

arraySize     numThreads     Speedup 1.      Speedup 2.     Speedup 3.
(1 << 15)        24         
(1 << 15)        32         
(1 << 15)        40        
(1 << 15)        48       
(1 << 20)        24      
(1 << 20)        32     
(1 << 20)        40    
(1 << 20)        48   


2. What is the asymptotic time complexity for the sequential sort for array
of size n? Explain your answer.


3. What is the asymptotic time complexity for the parallel sorts assuming that
the number of threads is p. Explain your answers.

a. Parallel Sort 1
b. Parallel Sort 2
c. Parallel Sort 3

4. Your results should indicate that increasing the number of threads also
causes an increase in the speedup.  Explain why.


5. Your results should indicate that there is a higher speedup for the
larger array size.  Explain why.
